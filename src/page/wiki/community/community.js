Q: What are Wild Cards?
----------------------
< Wild Cards allow a player to include either 3 copies of a single card or 2 copies of two different cards in their deck. >

Q: What is Glory?
----------------------
< Glory does not make cards stronger stats-wise, but grants a bronze, silver, and gold frame to the card at given thresholds and speeds up the Battle Pass progress. >

Q: How do I find out more about a card's stats and abilities?
------------------------------------------------------------
        < Right clicking on the card will bring up a page with a description and detailed stats. Note that you can also look at your opponent's deck after a match or navigate to the recruiting menu and right click to see what the cards do, even if you don't own them! >

  Q: How do I edit my deck & craft new cards with my Shards?
    -----------------------------------------------------------
      < Click on your deck at the top of the screen to edit it. To enter the crafting menu, click on the blue 'Recruiting' button. >

Q: Are there different Masters available?
----------------------------------------
  <  There are currently nine Masters, each with their own unique sets of perks! View them all by clicking on your starting Master, the archer Stormbringer, in the center of the main menu. In addition, you can customize your loadout with Master skins and Arenas purchased in the shop unlocked at level 7! >

Q: What happens in the event of a tie?
-------------------------------------
        < Draws do not currently exist. Instead, victory is awarded to what the server deems as Player 1. Player 1 is the player that connected to the match first. >

          Q: Is there anywhere I can view specific game data?
          -------------------------------------
