            I remember when I started playing this game that was not easy to get into it, because
            there is a lot of stuff to do and you might not get it all at first so you might end up
            missing something important.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let's start with the resources:
            <br />

                <b>Gold</b>: gold is very important since it's your primary source of shards and
                cards. Spend this in the shop on good offers (especially to boost the cards you use)
                or to get power tokens (we'll see later why).

                <b>Shards</b>: shards are extremely important since with this you can craft cards.
                You shouldn't haste in spending shards since they are not easy to come by, spend
                them only to craft cards you really need, and start upgrading cards only when you
                are sure you don't need any other card.
                <br />
                You should NOT spend shards on season cards until you reach tier 99 or you will just
                spend 3 times more!!!

                <b>Rubies</b>: rubies are the most precious resource you have, you can rarely obtain
                it as a reward, and they can be bought for real money. With rubies you can buy stuff
                that with time can be obtained anyway. So how to get rubies is a personal choice
                based on if you have more time or money available. Just remember that even if you
                can buy enough rubies to get all the cards and masters (spending them wisely it can
                be done with about 200€), <u>this won't give you any advantage in the game</u>, in
                fact the more stuff you have at the beginning, the more will be complicated for you
                to make a decent deck since you'll have too many options and not enough knowledge of
                the game to make a good choice.
                <br />
                <br />
                Remember to always keep 1,500 rubies available for the battle pass. That's one of
                the best ways to spend rubies since the rewards are usually VERY good!

            To better understand the prices in the shop, you need to know the currency conversion:
            <br />
            1k gold = 80 rubies = 125 shards
            <br />
            <br />
            Also remember that you get 1 card from 1 token which cost 1k gold. So if you see for
            example 25 common cards for 5k gold, it is actually a nice deal since you'll have to get
            25 tokens to get the same amount of cards.
            <br />
            Just remember that a token gives you a card AND shards and the shop offers only give you
            the cards (you get shards only if you get beyond 400 glory for a specific card), so
            going back to the previous example, if you get 25 tokens and you get 25 common cards you
            also get 75 shards, so it's still a very good deal.
            <br />
            <br />
            In general, if you see a single card for sell for less than 1k, is always a good deal.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, this is only if we speak about gold, if we speak about rubies, things are a bit
            different, since they are harder to come by, so you should only spend them for something
            that is really good...
            <br />
            <br />
            If you have any doubt about if a shop offer is worth buying, do not hesitate to ask in
            general chat, there always is some veteran player that can help you with that.

            The cards drop rates when using a power token are one of the most asked question about
            this game, so here is the answer:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul className="bb_ul">
              <li>
                {" "}
                <b>Common (GREEN)</b>: 50%
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                <b>Rare (BLUE)</b>: 40%
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                <b>Supreme (PURPLE)</b>: 8%
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                <b>Legendary (GOLD)</b>: 2%
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            As said before: remember that tokens are for <u>SHARDS</u>, so <b>DO NOT</b> obsess over
            tokens trying to get the card you want or you'll end up selling you're house before you
            find what you're looking for...
            <br />
            <br />
            Season Tokens turn into normal tokens at the end of the season so you have 2 options:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul className="bb_ul">
              <li>
                {" "}
                Use them all and upgrade all you're season cards before the season end. If you level
                up enough in the season, you'll have 90% of the season cards at least at 200+ glory,
                you can even get 1-2 of them to 400 glory too if you're lucky enough!
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Keep all the season tokens and open them AFTER the season end. Several people like
                to do this, mostly because they don't like (or don't need) the season cards, and
                they'd rather spin normal tokens instead. If you still need most of the NON-SEASONAL
                cards, this can be a good method to find them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Personally I use all the season tokens so I can level up as much as possible the season
            cards, then I spend gold to buy normal tokens/good shop offers to level up the other
            cards. I also spend the shards to bring to 400 glory the card I use.{" "}

                This is your profile, and in here you can find the quests and the achievements. This
                part is VERY important, and you should check it every day to make sure what you have
                to do and, most important of all, to collect the rewards.
                <br />
                <br />
                The daily quests can be re-rolled once a day by clicking the round arrow on the
                right of it, and you should do that to find the "Win 10 games" quest, since it's the
                one that pay the greater amount of gold of all. Obviously if you get a quest for
                1.600 gold is good too, so don't re-roll it or you'll risk to get a 1.000 gold one.
                <br />

                    minimum), which in the worst case is 500 gold.

                    Season tokens can be found by playing the season battle pass, and these tokens
                    are the only way to obtain the newest cards. These cards can be crafted (like
                    every other card), but they cost 3 times more (until you reach tier 99 in the
                    battle pass), so using these tokens is the best thing to do to get and upgrade
                    them.

                    Power tokens are the best way to spend the excess of gold. Using these tokens
                    provides you new cards (or upgrade for duplicates), but most important of all
                    shards. When you play power tokens always remember to do it for the shards and
                    DO NOT obsess trying to get a specific card or you'll just end up disappointed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Like the daily free token, this tokens provide a guaranteed better reward every
                    5 of them.

                Season and power tokens rewards you with shards based on the type of card you get:
                <br />
                Common: 15 shards (+25 if the card is already at 400 glory)
                <br />
                Rare: 30 shards (+50 if the card is already at 400 glory)
                <br />
                Supreme: 75 shards (+125 if the card is already at 400 glory)
                <br />
                Legendary: 300 shards (+500 if the card is already at 400 glory)
                <br />
                <br />
                If you reach 400 glory on a card and you find that card again while using a token or
                by buying a bundle in the shop, you will receive a generous amount of extra shards.

                The contest area is very important since it can provide you with some powerful
                reward.
                <br />
                Usually the contest has a series of keys to obtain, you'll get one randomly while
                playing a specific master or, while watching a streamer, everytime he gets a key you
                also get a key. The keys awarded by the twitch drops will be available on the next
                login.
                <br />
                Completing a section gives you the final reward, but getting all the keys is still
                worth it since you'll get shards from them, and even if 10 shards looks a small
                amount, when you get them all you will have many more (sometimes even 600!!!)

            Watching the most popular streamers is also a good way to earn resources!
            <br />
            In fact the BetaDwarf provides them giveaway packages to be given away, and the more
            viewer they have, the bigger the packages will be, so be sure you don't miss your chance
            in their raffle (especially if you are a new player)!
            <br />
            <br />
            While viewing a stream on twitch, there are several commands that you can use to
            interact with the game by changing your puff style or by throwing stuff in the arena.
            All the commands available can be found here:{" "}

            <br />
            <br />
            Also by watching the streamers, you will receive drops when they win! Drops grant you 50
            gold (and eventually a key of the tri-team event).
            <br />
            The drops can be collected on login. <div style={{ clear: "both" }} />

            In addition to the giveaways that you can get from the streamers, there are also few

            One last basic concept that you should know is that while you can quit the game at any
            time, and you can even choose to do so during a 1 vs 1 game to "resign", you should{" "}
            <b>NEVER</b> do that on a team battle game, no matter what.
            <br />
            Always remember that in a team battle everything can happen, and sometimes even if it
            looks like you are losing, your teammate could have an ace in the sleeve that will save
            the game. Personally I've won games with less than 20hp left, because sometimes it's
            just a matter of luck too!
            <br />
            Remember that leaving a team battle will prevent you from playing another game for
            several minutes, while leaving at the beginning of a team battle is a bannable offense.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also <b>NEVER</b> queue for a team match and go away from the computer, that's why it
            says "ESTIMATED" time, because you could get it in 1 second or more than the timer says,
            and you'll might end up ruining someone game.

            it could happen), people who go away during a team match, or people who quit at the

            To begin let me just give you a couple of info on what's the goal of the game and what
            you should expect.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this game, the main goal is raising your rank in one (or more) modes. So first of
            all, you need to determine what type of game mode you like most.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are 3 main game modes:
            <br />
            <ul className="bb_ul">
              <li>
                {" "}
                Battle (1vs1): this is basically a duel, and the chance of raising the rank depends
                totally on your skills.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Premade Team Battle (2vs2 with a friend): this is a team battle with one of your
                friend as teammate, so climbing the ranks in this mode requires that you and your
                friend work together to build a winning strategy, while is harder than the 1vs1, is
                surely more satisfiying.
                <br />
                <br />

              <li>
                {" "}
                Team Battle (2vs2): this is a team battle with a <b>RANDOM</b> teammate, which means
                that your chance of raising the rank depends on your skill and on your luck of
                getting a good teammate who knows what to do and with a deck compatible with your
                own. This is by far the hardest mode and it requires more time and skill (yes, luck
                is also a skill!) to climb the ranks.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <div className="subSectionTitle">The Game Purpose - Ranks </div>
          <div className="subSectionDesc">
            The ranks are:
            <br />
            Wood &gt; Stone &gt; Bronze &gt; Silver &gt; Gold &gt; Platinum &gt; Diamond &gt; Master
            &gt; Grand Master
            <br />
            <br />
            Everytime you win you gain points to get to the next rank, losing however decrease your
            points and eventually your rank (once you reach Grand Master, you won't be demoted
            anymore). Winning more times on a row, also grants bonus points!
            <br />
            <br />
            Raising your rank provides you with increasing rewards, but beware! Ranks reset at the
            end of every month and the reset rewards you based on how high you got.
            <br />
            <br />
            Very often people ask what's a good rank, the answer is: before platinum is just a
            warm-up, from platinum you start to play seriously, so don't get too cocky if at the
            beginning you never lose... <div style={{ clear: "both" }} />

            To play draft you have to pay 750 gold (or 55 rubies), and while more complicated and
            more subject to luck, this mode rewards you based on the amount of victories you
            achieve. In this mode you get to pick a random master and to build a random deck with
            limited choices, so don't rush and think before you pick a card or you might end up
            regretting it.
            <br />
            This mode always rewards you with 1 or more cards, if you achieve 8 or more victories
            there is also a good chance that the card you get is legendary. BUT remember that you
            can lose only 3 times, after that you have to start all over again!
            <br />
            In order to gain enough gold to cover the fee, you need to win 8+ times so make sure you
            have a high understanding of the game before you waste all your money with this mode...

            <br />
            After experimenting and getting some pointers from Thoughtcast, here is a little guide
            on how to build a functional draft deck:
            <br />
            <ul className="bb_ul">
              <li>
                {" "}

                    {" "}
                    Zap Shrine can be very useful against Rammers and Cleavers.
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Wall can be a decent defensive option.
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Consider only attack building if the other cards are bad.
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Do not take spawners (except Crossbow Guild).
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Bridge Shrine is also a viable building (especially if you are using Diona),
                    since it will speed up your way to Mana Frenzy.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Prioritize ranged units over melee (if they are of similar strength). If you don't
                have ranged you will lose against air units.
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Take at least 1 card that cost 6+ mana if you have the chance. If you are using
                Mordar as master, you can afford more. This cards are hard to take down and you're
                opponent may struggle against them. The Dragons Pack is a very good card since many
                players playing draft may not have spells or the proper minions to counter them.
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Take max 2 strong attack spells (Like Fireball, Magma Storm, Chain Lightning,
                etc..). Ignore utility spells like Black Hole, Healing Fireball, etc.. because those
                are rarely of any use if you can't plan the deck. <br />
                Future Present/Past, are always good choices. <br />
                Shock Rock and Gambler's Ball can be taken if you use Settsu (to trigger the Combat
                Reload).
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Any card below 3 mana is only good to take the bridges or to stop a cleaver, so
                don't take too many of those. Crossbow Dudes is bad anti-air so it enters in this
                category.
                <br />
                If you have one of this cards at start, make sure to use them to capture the bridge,
                because your opponent may not have anything like that and this will give you a big
                XP advantage early on.

                Do not take Trobadour or Living Statue, or any other mana expensive card that works
                only against buildings because you won't be able to use them properly without being
                able to plan your deck.

            Like for the draft, the mayhem mode cost 750 gold to play and rewards you based on how
            many victories you achieve. The main difference is that you have to build the deck
            BEFORE starting (once you started you can't change the deck anymore), and every mayhem
            has a different condition that makes it very fun to play, but often is also more
            complicated than normal. Also, the Mayhem mode is available only once a week for 3 days.
            <br />
            In any case, while the draft can only be played in solo, the mayhem can also be played
            with a friend making it more interesting, and the rewards are fixed and quite appetible
            if you can achieve 12 victories.

                their master, it means you'll take down your opponent pretty fast...

            +2 and -2. The change is permanent through the game and it can stack multiple times.

            The other objective of this game is to progress in the current season. Why? because the
            battle pass provides you with a lot of currency, skins, cards and tokens for the new
            cards!
            <br />
            To do that, you just need to increase the glory of your deck (the glory is indicated by
            the number in the big star near your deck). Leveling up cards doesn't give you any
            advantage in game, but increase the card glory, and the total glory is exactly how many
            points you get when you win a battle as progress through the season.
            <br />
            During the season you earn gold stars (up to 4 at tier 54), and each gold star will turn
            a card with the lowest glory to 400 (400 is the max glory that a card can have).
            Duplicate cards count as 0 glory so be careful!
            <br />
            The maximum amount of glory you can have on a deck (given that you have all the season
            bonus), is 4,600 points (4,550 during mini seasons).
            <br />
            Each day you also get 3 battle chests which will count as 10 times your deck glory each,
            and when you earn all 3 (by winning 3 times), all that glory will be added to your total
            progress, which means that you will gain several tiers (up to 3 with max glory). So if
            you don't have much time to play, 3 victories at day with an high glory deck is the way
            to go!
            <br />
            <u>NOTE: </u>The last day of the battle pass, you can complete 3 battle chests and get 3
            new one for the new season as soon as it starts, so don't keep 2 and think you can make
            the third when the season starts because you will just lose them...
            <br />
            <br />
            Buying the battle pass for the season is always good since the rewards are really great
            (if you can afford it). If you buy the battle pass you'll receive all the rewards for
            the tiers already reached and all the future one till the end of the season (you
            obviously have to re-buy the battle pass the next season).
            <br />
            <br />
            Buying tiers for rubies is NOT worth it, since you have enough time to complete the
            season even with 1 month left (the seasons usually starts with 65 days), and the rewards
            beyond tier 100 are not really good, so don't feel the need to hurry!

            </div>
            <br />
            In order to contribute in the guild pass, you need to use a deck with a high amount of
            glory, and possibly to use the conquest cards. Each conquest card in your deck provides
            extra 400 glory for the guild pass.
            <br />
            <b>
              <u>NOTE:</u>
            </b>{" "}
            every guild has a different set of conquest cards.
            <br />
            <br />
            To contribute, just enable the conquest mode from the guild screen, then you can play in
            any mode (excluding draft, mayhem and expeditions) and your victories will count towards
            the guild pass. If your conquest mode is active, the guild emblem will be visible near
            the usual "Battle" button to start a game.
            <br />
            <br />
            The total glory you'll receive after each victory is: <br />
            <b>
              ( &lt;Conquest Card Glory&gt; + &lt;Your Deck Glory&gt; + &lt;Season Bonus Glory&gt; )

            </b>
            <br />

            The ranks mutipliers are the following:

            The multiplier for the formula above is ( xx% / 100 ) + 1. Example for GM is 3.5.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your total contribution for the cycle is visible in the guild screen, and the guild
            roster shows your total contribution for the season.
            <br />
            <br />
            All the glory earned by the <b>TOP 20 GUILD MEMBERS</b> will be added to the guild pass

            remember that once you have lost 3 times there is no way to try again (is not like

            lose streak, remember to pause the conquest and to resume at better times.

            cards, each member also earn skins, avatars, a frame border for your avatar and cards
            pack (like 5 or more copies of a single card) of an increasing rarity, up to 3
            legendaries at tier 20.

            That said, there is no website or golden deck that makes you win like crazy. If you want
            to progress in this game you need to work on your strategies and to learn from your
            mistakes.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are few rules I can give you to increase your chances of success and avoid some
            rookies mistakes:
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Have a plan!
                <br />
                While it seems obvious, for many people is not. When you are building a deck you
                need to have a plan of attack, from the simplest: "let's spawn minions until the
                enemy can't handle them anymore", to more complicate strategies based on 1 or more
                specific cards.
                <br />
                The important thing is: DO NOT make a deck with random cards and hope for the best,
                because you'll end up losing over and over again, also don't copy decks that you
                find around if you don't know the strategy behind it.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Don't panic!
                <br />
                Sometimes things may get out of hand and everything may look bad like you are going
                to lose. In this case don't panic, think what you can do, and do it! It may not look
                like a winning move at the time, but sometimes if you prevent even just 50 damage at
                the right moment you may get a chance to turn the table in your favor and even win!
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Use your own side of the battlefield:
                <br />
                Throwing your minions at the base of the bridge is the worst thing you can do,
                because you'll make those minions an easy target, easy to kill. Use your side of the
                battlefield to build your push, and your defense so you can cut your opponent's
                minions from behind and stop them more easily.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Mana cost:
                <br />
                The average mana cost is a VERY important factor of your deck. I know that big fat
                minions deal huge amount of damage, but what's the point if you lose before you can
                drop them?
                <br />
                The golden rule here is to keep the mana cost around 3.5, you can get to 3.8, 4 top,
                but beyond that your deck is just trash (there are few exception here, but unless
                you are a VERY experienced player, stick with this rule).
                <br />
                <br />
                Why is so important to keep the mana cost low?
                <br />
                While there are many strategies around, we can take them all and categorize them in
                2 groups:
                <br />
                Big minions push or swarming.
                <br />
                We'll see the details about those strategies later, but the point is that if your
                opponent is swarming you, you need to spawn your minions fast enough to stop those
                hordes (and if you have only big cards you can't), also if your opponent is throwing
                at you some big minions, you need to be able to have backups to take him down before
                it reaches your tower.
                <br />
                <br />
                So in general you should have something very small (to capture bridges), something
                small, something medium and maybe something big to kill the enemy tower.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Field Pressure:
                <br />
                They key to win is to keep your opponent under pressure, so that he has to use all
                his mana to defend. Basically if you manage to keep your opponent busy defending all
                the time, even if you are not damaging his tower, you're going to win because you're
                going to reach mana frenzy before him and at that point he will not be able to stop
                you anymore.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sometimes using a big scary minion can increase the pressure over your opponent,
                because he could panic and waste more mana that is required to kill it, giving you
                an opening for a strong push.
                <br />
                <br />
                Just remember: defense always comes first, pushing comes later.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Spells:
                <br />
                While spells are good and all, too many of those will make you lose. The max amount
                of spells to use is 2-3 (4 top if you are using Milloween), beyond that you will
                become too vulnerable to be able to win.
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>

                Counters:
                <br />
                Countering the most common minions is necessary no matter what!
                <br />
                <br />
                The most important thing about countering is the mana ratio of what you use to
                counter vs what you are countering. For example if you use a Fireball (4 mana) to
                counter Stun Lancers + Annihilator (9 mana total), you gained 5 mana over your
                opponent, while if you use Fireball (4 mana) to counter a Scrat Pack (1 mana), you
                lose 3 mana over your opponent.
                <br />
                As long as your mana ratio is 0 or positive, you are ok, but if you start to lose
                mana while countering, there is a high change that you are going to lose the game.
                <br />
                <br />
                So you must always be prepare to stop the following minions (or risk losing):
                <br />
                <ul className="bb_ul">
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Rammers, brutes, colossus and co.: this minions are VERY common and quite
                    distruptive, so try to stop them with minions like stun lancers or a simple
                    wall. The divine warrior is also very good to soak their damage in case of
                    emergency (excluding the rammers).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Minion packs: if your opponent is trying to swarm you, you must be ready with at
                    least 1 minion that cause AOE damage (like the fire imp), or at least a spell
                    like daggerfall.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Ranged and Flying minions: everyone has a flying minion, and you need to have
                    something to take them down, or they can deal serious damage to your tower.
                    Anti-aircraft units (ranged in general) are required especially for masters like
                    Volco since he can't attack flying units on his own.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You should also have at least 1 flying unit since it will give you a good
                    advantage against many minions that can only attack on the ground (like the
                    colossus).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Also certain spells like daggerfall or chain lightning are very effective
                    against ranged units (like plasma marines) and certain flying units (like bats
                    and buzzers).

                Tanks:
                <br />
                While the concept is obvious, I'd like to remind you that having at least 2 tanks in
                a deck is vital.
                <br />
                You should always have a strong tank (like divine warrior or even the colossus) to
                stop the strong enemy pushes and soak damage while your minions clear the field and
                a medium tank to support your pushes toward the enemy tower.
                <br />
                <br />
                Is always a good idea to place a tank in front of your ranged units to protect them
                and allow them to deal damage safely (since most ranged units have very few hp).
                <br />
                <br />
              </li>

                Supports and healers:
                <br />
                While in this game is not required for you to have support units, for some
                strategies is necessary.
                <br />
                For example if you plan to use a sniper, always take the bannerman to protect it
                from spell damages or it will be destroyed in 1 shot.
                <br />
                If you use big minions like colossus or blue golem, is always a good tactic to put a
                priestess to keep them healthy behind them.
                <br />
                If you have an harbinger is always wise to pair him with a healing shrine or a
                priestess.
                <br />
                <br />
                The healing ball and the healing puff are also very useful if you learn to use them

                This is the first master you get, and has a great sinergy with ranged minions since
                it increase the maximum range of all the ranged units you play. <br />
                Try to use this to your advantage by either swarming your enemy with small ranged
                minions or by playing strong ranged units that can breach the enemy tower from a
                safe distance.

                Stormbringer in team with another Stormbringer can keep your opponent under
                pressure, since your opponent will be forced to constantly maintain a tank to soak
                the damage or take 70 damage every 4 seconds (2 seconds if you reach perk 3).
                <br />
                Aereodynamics is also shared with your teammate, so Stormbringer can also be paired
                with any other master as long as your teammate has ranged units that can use

                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                Ravager is quite a simple master to use. The core feature of ravager are 2: the free
                big minion that spawns at level 1 and 3, and the fact that all your minions will
                goes to frenzy when below 50% hp (which means +50% movement and attack speed).
                <br />
                There are several possible strategies involving the ravager capabilities, from using
                the free minions to lead a big deadly push, to using medium minions like the
                succubus (or even the colossus) empowered by enrage to cause huge damage thanks to
                the frenzy bonus. Just remember that NOT all the minions are affected by frenzy.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Ravager can be paired in team with another Ravager to create a very strong attack
                force with 2 Brutus, but you'll need to be careful because your tower won't have any
                defense against ranged units (unless you spawn some minions to do it).
                <br />
                Feeding Frenzy is shared with your teammate, so you can plan a strategy to get the
                most out of it.
                <br />
                If you are paired with Volco or Mordar, your tower defense will be really weak, so
                make sure to bring strong minions to defend.
                <br />
                Mordar's tombstones can resurrect Brutus, and at perk 3 it will be even stronger
                when resurrected (since it will also gain frenzy without losing 50% hp).

                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                Settsu is a master that requires some skill and tactics to be mastered. The core
                feature is the ability to go into the field causing 50 damage in the landing zone
                and then either use her as tank to lead a push, or to surgically strike an enemy
                (like the Harbinger) or the enemy tower itself.
                <br />
                The ability to use a spell to instant recharge her rifle and to stun the enemies
                (with perk 3), is probably the hardest thing to master while using Settsu.
                <br />
                Plan your deck accordigly making sure you have at least 1 fast spell to use for fast
                reloading her gun while she's on the battlefield, and enough minions to keep your
                opponent busy.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Settsu can synergize well with any master since she's a hero that works
                indipendently with a good deck, and can really save the day if your teammate is not
                really strong.
                <br />
                Settsu can take advantage of the Aereodynamics perk from Stormbringer and Feeding
                Frenzy from Ravager, both giving you a solid advantage while using Blast Entry.

                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                This master requires 2 main skills:
                <br />
                <ul className="bb_ul">
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Knowing when to play the totem to protect your tower.
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li> Knowing how to use the free cards to make your deck more mana efficient.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                The totem should always be used to soak major damage or when your tower is overrun
                so that you could Magma Storm the area safely.
                <br />
                <br />
                The free cards however, should always be used while you need to regenerate mana for
                something good, so you can regenerate mana and keep applying pressure in the
                battlefield at the same time.
                <br />
                <br />A common tactic is to have 2 Future Present cards in hand, so at the beginning
                of the game (when the mana regenerate slowly), Apep shoots fast against anything
                that comes against you. The Future Present cards can be used safely at late game
                (when the mana regenerates faster), so you can get some powerful minion at
                discounted mana cost to finish your enemy.
                <br />
                <u>NOTE</u>: trying to use Future Present at the beginning of a game is almost
                always a suicide move, so DON'T do it (unless things are going insanely well).

                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Apep works well with any master, but having another Apep or King Puff as teammate ,
                can provide extra shielding for the tower making your team really hard to beat when
                you reach perk 3.

                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                Diona is a master well suited for both support and attack decks. The basic toolkit
                of this master provides several traps (2 of which can be placed anywhere in the
                map), that helps to taunt and root the enemies, while if you protect the dog when it
                goes to fetch the potions, it will provide you with extra mana and free healing.
                <br />
                This master sinergize well with a support deck team oriented (with guardian +
                priestess for example), but it also has a nice aggressive sinergy with big minions,
                since you can use the taunt trap to allow them to reach the enemy tower
                unchallenged.
                <br />
                The main difficulty is in the timing and placement of the traps which takes some
                practice to master. If you fail to place a trap means that you will lose it almost
                instantly, so be careful!
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>NOTE</u>: you can use the traps to capture bridges (just spawn a trap on an empty

                Diona is very versatile so she works well with any master, however, having another
                Diona as teammate will double the traps giving your team more defense and bridge
                control.

                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                King Puff is a peculiar master to play. The core feature is that all the minions of
                4 and 5 mana will get randomly either rage or a shield, and you can swap the minions
                between brideges (stunning the enemy ones in the process). Also at level 3, as long
                as you keep control of the bridge with the crown symbol, your tower will be
                completely invulnerable.
                <br />A good strategy for this master, is to have some key minions of 4 and 5 mana
                (DO NOT put only 4-5 mana minions!!!), use this empowered minions to strike deadly
                damage to your opponent tower, while you use a solid tank with other small minions
                to keep control of the marked bridge to ensure your invulnerability.
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>NOTE:</u> Knowing how to use efficiently Trick Swap makes the difference between
                winning and losing.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Since King Puff decks tent to be slow, it requires a teammate capable of helping you
                defend for a couple of minutes until the mana regeneration is a bit faster. The
                Bridge Shield mark is shared with your teammate, making it easier to manage it.
                <br />
                King Buff is NOT shared with your teammate, so if he's not using another King Puff
                he won't get any advantage from it.
                <br />
                If you team up with Apep your team becomes really strong, since the Shield Totem can
                be used to protect your tower from damage while you try to get the Bridge Shield
                back.

                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                Mordar is a master that requires some planning. The core feature of Mordar are the
                tombstones, that after 10s from the placement, will resurrect the first minion that
                dies.
                <br />
                This feature gives you several possible strategies, from the most raw like using the
                tombstones to soak the enemies damage (like the walls), to more complex ones like
                having big minion (like a colossus or a harbinger) to push, die, come back to life
                up until your opponent is swarmed by huge minions that cannot be stopped.
                <br />
                It's basically all about the timing from when you place the tombstone to when the
                minon dies, and to make sure the right minion get resurrected.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Mordar can be used in team with another Mordar to double the amount of tombstones
                and become really oppressive for your opponent if he can't destroy them.
                <br />
                Mordar can also work with any other master except Ratbo (never pair Mordar and Ratbo
                unless you want to waste all tombstones on scrats), as long as they can provide a
                good tower defense (since Mordar damage is very low).
                <br />
                Tombstones are shared with your opponent, so if your teammate minion dies before
                yours, that is the one which is going to be resurrected. If you are in team with
                Ratbo, your tombstones will be quite useless since they will be wasted on scrats.

                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                This master requires some experience in swarming in order to use it properly. In
                fact the core feature of ratbo is the ability of spawn scrats everytime you play a
                minion card, and his second perk ability deal damage based on how many minions you
                have alive in that moment.
                <br />
                The best (and probably only) strategy to use ratbo properly, is to use small and
                medium cards to swarm your opponent, and to use the "More Dakka!" ability when you
                have alot of minions around to deal devastating damage to big enemy minions (or the
                opponent tower).

                Ratbo can work well with another Ratbo, since that will double the amount of scrats

                also work with Ratbo, better if they have hordes in their deck to boost your More
                Dakka! damage when needed.

                <u>NOTE</u>: Volco can damage only GROUND minions, so keep some minion ready to deal
                with air units.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                This is a tricky one to master. The core strength of Volco is the first perk that
                allows you to deal 60 damage to the enemy tower everytime you play a card, as long
                as you keep control of the bridge marked with the hammer.
                <br />
                This means that the best tactics is to have a lot of small cards that you can spam
                in order to deal damage to the enemy tower very fast, but also you need to have a
                solid strategy to maintain the control of the marked bridge all the time (by using a
                solid tank like the colossus for example).
                <br />
                <br />
                Another solid tactic is to plan a way to survive until you reach the third perk and
                then cause massive damage with melee units (since all melee units gets free rage).
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Volco can work well with another Volco since the Afterburner mark is shared
                (allowing your team to deal a lot of damage by simply playing a card), but it's also
                very dangerous if you don't have a solid air defense to protect the tower.
                <br />
                Tempers Flaring is shared with your teammate, so if you are teamed up with someone
                that has a lot of melee units is very good. Ravager Brutus is also affected by
                Tempers Flaring, and paired with Feeding Frenzy, it can make your units VERY strong
                (as long as you can reach perk 3 safely).

                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Tactics</b>:<br />
                This is probably the hardest master to play. The core ability is the arcane golem, a
                minion that cost 3 mana and increase hp and damage for every spell you cast (up to
                10 stacks).
                <br />
                The entire strategy of Milloween rotate around the arcane golem, so at level 3 when
                your golem has 5 stacks from the moment it spawns, you'll start to deal massive
                damage if you protect it long enough. So in short, you need to build a deck to
                empower and protect the arcane golem, and make sure you can level up fast enough to
                get to level 3 and ensure your victory.
                <br />
                Milloween works well with fast decks with few spells (even just 1) and a solid tank
                to protect the arcane golem.
                <br />
                <br />
                Something to remember is that Arcane Missiles can kill Xiao Long (even when
                enraged).
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Team Synergies</b>:<br />
                Milloween is a slow paced master that requires a teammate capable of defending at
                least until perk 1 when you get the Arcane Golem.
                <br />
                Unfortunately only YOUR spells count for the golem empowering and if a Mordar's
                tombstone resurrects it, your teammate will have to build up stacks on the
                resurrected Arcane Golem instead of you.
                <br />
                Using double Milloween can be really strong late game, but it's extremely hard to
                survive at start, so if you plan to do this, also plan for a strong defense stragety
                to resist long enough until you get to perk 3.

                A control deck is designed to maintain the control of the bridges and to counter
                anything that comes in your way. This kind of decks are usually effective in 2v2
                since you can defend while you're teammate attacks the enemy.
                <br />
                If you plan to use a control deck, remember that you can only win late game (in mana
                frenzy most of the times).

                <br />

                The swarming strategies are mainly designed to spawn so many minions that your
                opponent won't be able to stop you.
                <br />
                This strategies are not very effective on early game, but they become lethal if you
                manage to reach mana frenzy!
                <br />
                <br />
                This kind of strategy is fairly common with masters like Ratbo or Volco, since they
                synergize very well with cards that can be spammed.

                This strategy requires you to escort one big fat minion to the enemy tower to cause
                massive damage. Since the big fat minions have huge amount of hp, some tactics can
                involve using them as distraction while you deal the real damage with smaller
                minions.
                <br />
                <br />
                This strategy is very good with Mordar since he can resurrect the fallen big minions
                with the tombstones.

            Having your core strategy in mind, now you need to do as follow:
            <br />

              <li>
                {" "}
                Pick 1-3 cards that will be the core of your deck. Those cards will determine HOW
                you are going to win. For example, you like the Colossus, so you want to use him to
                destroy your enemy.
                <br />
                <br />
                You can choose to use meta cards (knowing that those are highly countered), or you
                can make an "out of the box" choice that will give you the chance to take your
                opponent by surprise.
                <br />
                <br />

              <li>
                {" "}
                Now that you know what you want to win, choose a secondary win condition (in case
                your opponent is countering your main one).
                <br />
                The best way is to make sure that both winning conditions can support each other.
                <br />
                Using the previous example of the Colossus, your secondary winning strategy might be
                using a Harbinger. So if you're opponent has good ways to counter the Colossus,
                there is a good chance is not able to stop your Harbinger. Both winning conditions
                can be used together becoming even more effective.
                <br />
                <br />

              <li>
                {" "}
                Once you have the win condition set, you are left with fillers cards. Do you have
                enough anti-air that your deck won't suffer if enemy has slightly more air units? Do
                you have anti swarm so you don't have to summon 3 units to deal with legionnaires?
                Do you have a way to stop a big minion? Do you have enough bridge control? <br />
                Your best bet is to fill those spots with cards that excel at those roles or fill
                multiple at once. But also consider enemy's response to every one of your filler. If
                you take a dragon as your only way to kill big units, try to have a tank unit to
                prevent it from dying from ranged support. Keep putting the fillers and covering
                their own gaps as much as you can.

                Now when it comes to changing a deck to survive in a meta, you try to do the
                similar. Detect a card that is just not worth it, such as you never get a good value
                out of, is maybe too situational, or simply doesn't cooperate with the rest of your
                deck because you use its combo cards to answer different things. Or maybe you just
                found a card that keeps the same purpose as the one you are removing, but performs
                better against the meta you are fighting against. Take it out, put a card you find
                more suitable, run a check to make sure you didn't expose yourself to some common
                weakness, and give it a try.

                Always make sure the average mana cost of your deck is around 3.5-4, a higher value

                start.

            The harder you try to counter a specific decks, the more vulnerable you are to something
            off-meta, so always try to pick counters that aren't just here to counter that 1 thing,
            but can also serve a general purpose against other decks.

              <b>TESTING AND GAMEPLAY</b>
            </div>
            <br />
            The test of the deck is the most important part of all, watch how your cards play out,
            learn your weakness and how your opponent is exploiting them, and change your deck
            trying to remove your weakness.
            <br />
            <br />
            If your deck involve the use of building like the bridge shrine or the crossbow guild,
            you'll need to protect them by placing it very close to your tower (on the left or right
            corner of your tower). By doing so they won't be attacked by minions and they can only
            be destroyed by spells (or if they decay with time). The same strategy can be used to
            position ranged units while your tower is under siege so they can shoot without being
            targeted by other minions (but they still can be targeted by spells and others AOE
            effects).
            <br />
            <br />
            Keep in mind that you can't build a perfect deck, in fact every deck is vulnerable to
            something, just make sure that you can survive with that vulnerability and when you
            reach a 60-70% winning rate, you can consider your deck a very good one.
            <br />
            <br />
            In premade team, you can plan with your friend a way to cover each other
            vulnerabilities, the real problem comes with random teammates where if you get someone
            with an incompatible deck or that doesn't know what to do you end up losing, so it will
            be harder to determine if your deck is good or not, but at the end of the day, as long
            as your rank is growing, you can be sure you're on the right path.
            <br />
            <br />
            The final tip I can give you is to always keep your eyes open and be ready to improve
            your deck over and over again. Also by watching twitch streamers you can learn a lot of
            interesting combo that you might like, so do not be afraid to test new decks. And
            remember, as I said above: out there, there always will be someone smarter or luckier
            than you, the important thing is to learn from your mistakes and improve :){" "}

                <br />
                <u>Requirements</u>: Rammer + Scrat Launcher
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Execution</u>: this is an easy and VERY annoying combo. When you're enemy is not
                expecting it, summon the rammer and place the scrat launcher at the same time. By
                doing so he has to choose if stop the rammer or use ranged to destroy the scrat
                launcher. In the meantime you can summon something to defend the scrat launcher
                (making your opponent losing more time), until you have won. This combo works best
                AFTER your opponent has used lots of mana so he can't counter it until it's too
                late.
                <br />
                The scrat launcher can be put even further away if you are using Stormbringer.
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Counters</u>: This combo is hard to counter since requires you to have something
                to stop the rammer (stun lancers, thorns, snake druid, etc...) AND a ranged (or any
                siege) minion to stop the scrat launcher. In any case you'll end up losing a lot of
                tower integrity...

                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Execution</u>: this combo is quite easy to execute, just hypnotize the enemy
                minions and use combustion to blow them up.
                <br />
                This combo is great to get rid of the dangerous minions your opponent might summon,
                bu also to turn all his defenses into plain damage against his tower.
                <br />
                <br />

                <u>Execution</u>: place the grasping thorns where you want to trap your enemy, then
                let the snake druid root it on the thorns. This combo works very well with big
                minions like living statue, blue golem, etc..., it won't work against colossus if
                you send some melee minions to attack him since he will destroy the thorns in 1
                shot.
                <br />
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Execution</u>: this combo is (in theory) very simple to execute, just summon your
                horde then activate combustion on them and look the enemies blow up!
                <br />
                This combo is quite effective against tanks, Cleavers, and anything with lots of HP
                (except the enemy tower).
                <br />
                Use Netherstep to skip targets if needed.
                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Counters</u>: to counter this combo there are 2 methods. The first one is to use
                an AOE spell to destroy the entire horde that is about to explode, just do it at the
                right time!
                <br />
                The second one is to use Black Hole to suck every combusted minion, so the
                combustion will fail.

                <br />
                <br />
                <u>Execution</u>: This combo is easy to execute, but requires some finesse if you
                want to avoid wasting a tons of mana for nothing. First of all remember that this
                combo requires at least 13 mana to be executed, so use it wisely to make big pushes.
                <br />
                To use this combo cast Armored Escort during idle moments, when you want to start
                your push, pile up enough mana to summon the ranged unit AND the bannerman
                immediately after. If possible try to prepare a tank to put in front of this bunch
                so they will last longer.
                <br />
                Stormbringer gains great advantage from this combo since all this ranged minions
                will be able to shoot from a further distance.

                still while you damage them.

                <br />
                <u>Execution</u>: To execute this combo you need to have several buildings in your

                If you plan this right, you can have an horde of warriors which (if properly
                supported) can cover your push with some other strong minion.
                <br />
                Mordar can also resurrect the fallen warriors with the tombstones and have a longer
                push towards the enemy tower!

                <br />
                <u>Counters</u>: countering this combo can be hard, since you might not be able to
                destroy all the buildings in time, so you need to stop the warriors horde with as
                much AOE as you can, without forgetting about the big minion behind them.

                madness. At this point the battle shi-hou will fight at maximum speed (the attack

            Burn the Bridges is a spell that sets the bridges on fire and damages every enemy ground
            minion on it. Make sure to use a tank or any unit to keep the enemy units on the bridge
            while it's burning to deal as much damage as possible.

            Burn the Bridges is a dangerous spell that can easily take down your ground units that
            are crossing a bridge. You can save your units by using Black Hole, and that's the only
            counter there is.
            <br />
            Scrat Tank, Divine Warrior and Tranquil Shi-Hou are the only units that can cross a
            bridge on fire without taking damage (the Scrat Tank will take damage if is fighting
            another melee unit).

            The Tombstone is a building that after 10 seconds resurrect the first friendly minion
            that dies (including your teammate minions). Timing the placement with a minion death
            requires some skill, but it can be very effective to get very expensive minions back
            without spending mana. After perk 3, the resurrected minions also gain Frenzy.
            <br />
            The Tombstone can also be used as wall in case of emergency.

            The Tombstone is dangerous and should be taken care as soon as possible. There are 2
            ways to counter a Tombstone: one is either to use stun spells (like Chain Lightning)
            since stun will reset the timer and your opponent will have to wait 10 more seconds
            after the stun ends for the resurrection to work. The second method is just use brute
            force with Magma Storm or Beam of Doom to destroy it. Since the Tombstone is usually in
            a safe place near your opponent tower, only spells can help you deal with them.

            More Dakka! is probably the most powerful spell in the game. This spell cause 40 damage
            per friendly minion you have around (including your teammate minions), hitting the enemy
            closest to your tower. <br />
            More Dakka! can potentially deal millions of damage if you have enough hordes around,
            the catch is making it hit what you need to. Use it when you're opponent has big minions
            close to your tower or when your opponent has no minions at all to hit his tower very
            hard.

            Trick Swap is a spell that swap all location of all units on the both bridges, and stuns
            enemy minions for 4 seconds. Using Trick Swap also swap the crown location (the mark

            perk 3).

            to swap the bridges when you're marked bridge is about to get overrun so you'll keep
            your protection.

            The Shield Totem can prevent all damage to the enemy tower, so it must be destroyed as
            soon as possible. Stunning the Shield Totem will make the enemy tower attackable for the
            duration of the stun. Using Fireball can weaken the Shield Totem enough to be destroyed.
            To destroy the Shield Totem completely you need to use Magma Storm or Beam of Doom.

            Blood Imps are free to use minions, but EXTREMELY dangerous to use, since all the damage
            they take (INCLUDING OVERKILL) will be taken by your tower too!
            <br />
            This minion is very useful as "spell bait" because your opponent will try to cause as
            much damage as possible tot he imps using spells. Just remember to have 1 or more Heal
            Puff in your deck to counter the damage you're tower will take from the imps. The Blood
            Imps works great with Commander Azali, making them an extremely annoying threat.

            The best way to counter the imps is to use spells, especially the Wheel of Doom spell.
            With that spell you will cause 300 damage to the enemy tower per imp killed (which can
            be an instant win if your opponent played 2 imp cards at once).{" "}

            Blast Entry is a spell that removes Settsu from the tower and let her to move in the
            battlefield. When Settsu land she'll deal 50 damage and she'll have 300 hp.
            <br />
            This spell is very useful to defend your tower when stunned, because by going down from
            it Settsu will be free to attack.
            <br />
            Blast Entry is also good to let Settsu tank to protect some of your minions or to strike
            directly the enemy tower.
            <br />
            Settsu will still have 5 shots then she'll need 5 seconds to recharge, unless you
            reached perk 2 and then you can cast a spell (like Shock Rock) to instantly recharge the
            rifle. Using this properly at perk 3, Settsu also stuns everything in a straight line in
            the direction she's shooting.
            <br />
            While on the ground, Settsu can also be affected by Rage or Frenzy (if in party with

            The Black Hole can be used to counter many spells, to either protect your units or to
            separate enemies. It's especially good to protect from Magma Storm and Combustion, while
            it won't be very effective against Beam Of Doom.

            Once active, you can see how many units have been caught in it by counting the colored
            dots, the red dots are enemies, the blue dots are friendly.

            When you sue Black Hole, remember that there is a half second delay before it actually
            protects the units. The same will happen when you spawn a new unit on top of the Black
            Hole: it will take half second to be protected by it.

            Call To Arms is a spell that transforms any building (excluding the master specific
            ones, like Mordar's Tombstones or Diona's Traps) into Warriors. The most effective
            building to transform is Thorns, since no minion will attack it (except AoE damage), and
            it's also useful to slow down your enemies.

            Combustion is a spell VERY effective to take down big minions or large group of
            medium-small minions. To use it effectively, just cast it on a group of friendly minions
            nearby what you want to take down, and wait for the big BOOM!
            <br />
            You can also use it on your minions with a big health pool to free them from Stun
            Lancers or groups of small minions.
            <br />
            Using Combustion against the enemy tower is useless since it will deal a very small
            damage (15 per minion that explodes).

            The Gor'Rakk Gate is a cheap spell that can summon: 7 Swarmers OR 2 Dragon Whelps OR 1
            Cleaver, but whatever it summons it will have Turncoat (it will change team when it
            falls under 50% hp).
            <br />
            This spell is a very good way to get a 2 mana Cleaver if you can then stop him when it
            turns on you. You can use Once Bitten on the cleaver so when it turns it will be a
            Werewolf instead (which is much easier to counter than a Cleaver).
            <br />
            Another trick you can use, is to use Gor'Rakk Gate when there are no other friendly
            minions, an then if a Cleaver spawn, you can use Gor'Rakk Sacrifice to turn the Cleaver
            (with turrncoat) in a normal Cleaver and all for just 5 mana instead of 6. Just make
            sure the turncoat doesn't trigger while transforming or you'll be sorry.

            The Grenadier is the cheapest AoE unit. Even tho it can only damage ground units, it's
            still very effective against small minions like Scrat or Crossbow Dudes. It really
            shines if you can protect him with a tank while he deal damage.

            The Heal Puff once he reach a bridge, will heal your tower by 25 hp per second. While it
            might look a small amount, if you manage to protect it long enough, he can restore your
            tower completely. It becomes very annoying when you place a shield or increase its life.

            The Mana Puff Madness spell creates 4 Mana Puffs for you and 4 for your opponent. You
            can use this spell as distraction for big minions (like Cleaver), to massively increase

            The Once Bitten spell allows you to infect one of your minions in the selected area with
            lycanthropy.
            <br />
            While the minion is picked randomly, you can manually select an area with only 1 minion.
            Just remember that you can cast this spell only on your side of the battlefield.
            <br />
            The best units to infect are the one with Rage AND/OR Frenzy, like Tantrum Throwers or
            Ravenous Swarmers or Morgrul's Ragers, you just need to be careful when to use them,
            because if they get stunned or killed BEFORE they transform they are as good as dead.
            <br />
            On death the Werewolf grants 1 Spectral Essence, and when you reach 20 essences, other
            cards will gain a bonus effect (granted by Accursed Ascension).

            The Arcane Golem is a DPS unit capable of dealing great damage. This unit gains 1 stack
            everytime you play a spell, and every stack grants extra damage and health (up to 10
            stacks). Each stacks increases the damage by 6 and the hp by 40 (the base damage is 40
            and base hp is 300).

            If protected by a tank, it will be your main asset for dealing damage. The best way to

            "Armored" Scrats and Scrat Horde can be useful against big minions like Cleavers, while

            The Gor'Rakk Sacrifice spell can be used on cheap minions to get a Cleaver. The minion
            will be picked randomly from all your minions around, so make sure to use this spell
            when you have 1 or more minions nearby your tower so that you can protect it. You could
            also use an Elite Swarmer to ensure it won't be killed with 1 spell.
            <br />
            You can also use Banner Man to protect the minion that is transforming from spells.
            <br />
            Remember that if you have another Cleaver around, it can also be targeted by the spell
            and re-transform into a Cleaver. This can be done on purpose to heal the Cleaver
            completely and prevent his death.
            <br />
            NOTE: the Cleaver won't retain the buff of the unit that gets transformed.

            The Sun Burn spell is an interesting spell that can be used either to kill units with
            100 or less hit points or to give Rage to one (or more) of your powerful units.

            The Sun Burn spell can be very annoying in the right hands, since it can kill your

            Xiao Long is one of the cheapest and most powerful flying unit in game. It's a perfect
            anti-spell unit if spawned right before your opponent uses a spell, since it will gain
            Shield, Rage and Frenzy if that happens. While is not very strong by default, once a
            spell is casted it becomes a force of nature, and can take down the enemy tower on his
            own if left unchecked.
            <br />
            Play Xiao Long just after playing a "spell bait" minion (like a Sniper Scrat, Crossbow
            Guild, Harbinger, etc...), and you'll be sure to trigger his Rage.

            Xiao Long is a dangerous unit that should not be underestimated. When is around avoid
            casting spells (a special icon will appear as warning over your spell cards too). Make
            sure to kill it fast when enraged with Tantrum Throwers, or any other ranged units with
            strong damage. Sun Burn and Arcane Missiles are the only spells capable of enraging and
            killing him in 1 shot (Beam of Doom too but it's extremely expensive to be used just for
            that). A well aimed Dragon Ball can remove Xiao Long Shield and the dragon can kill him
            too.
            <br />
            Milloween Arcane Missiles can kill Xiao Long even if he gets enraged.

            The Dragon Nest is a building that spawn a Flightless Dragon everytime you use a spell.
            Unfortunately the building lasts only 35 seconds and until late game (or in case you
            have lots of Mana Puffs), is not enough time to get value out of it. Consider that for 4
            mana you can spawn 3 Flightless Dragon, while to get the same amount with the nest you
            need at least 10 mana.
            <br />
            Besides that, the Flightless Dragons are units to be used defensively, so if you really
            need to use this building, use Once Bitten on the Flightless Dragons so they'll get more
            useful and another one will spawn at the same time.

            effective while defending to take down big minions in a very short time. Using them to

            The Ghost is a very insidious minion, since (if properly protected) in 4 seconds will
            steal the first unit it comes in contact with. It should be used to steal meaningful
            units like Colossus, Harbinger, etc... or in any case units with a large health pool
            since once stolen, the unit will lose 3% hp per second until it dies.

            You can also use the Ghost to steal your opponent's buildings, it comes very handy to
            steal the Scrat Launcher for example or Mordar tombstones to resurrect your minions

            Hypnotize is a spell that allows you to convert one or more units to your side for 5

            kill one unit (or building) ignoring any kind of shield and invulnerability.

            when your opponent is still trying to build his attack group.

            The Musketeer is a tank with the ability to dodge an attack every 3 seconds and reflect
            it back for double damage. While is quite weak against multiple minions, it's extremely
            effective against Cleaver or Colossus or any single big ground melee unit.

            The Propeller Horde is a group of 5 Propeller Scrats whith additional 5 if you have any

            Sending a Rammer on a bridge and using another dangerous unit (like Cleaver or Scrat

            You can also use a horde minion (like Scrat Horde, Blood Imps or even Last Stand), to
            cover him while charging towards the enemy tower. By doing so the horde will soak the
            damage (and stun) from any minion your opponent will use to try to stop him.

            resurrect in 25 seconds for another round. This unit is really good with Rage or if you
            are using Mordar, since everytime he dies, the tombstone will create another one.

            Every time it dies it grants 1 spectral essence, and when you reach 20 essences, other

            The Wheel of Doom is a spell that throws a big wheel in the chosen direction and deal
            300 damage to any unit in that line. If a unit DO NOT dies, the Wheel of Doom breaks and
            it won't go any further, otherwise it will break only when it reaches the end of the
            map.

            Arcane Bolt is a powerful but hard to use spell that can instatly kill any GROUND unit
            with less than 500 hp in the selected area. While it can be useful to kill units that
            you already know they spawn with less than 500 hp (like Bahra, Fire Imp, Defenso
            Chopper, etc..), it gets tricky to be used against other minions since you'll have to
            count the bars in the healthbar over their head (each bar is equal to 100 hp).
            <br />
            Another weakness of this spell is that can be blocked by shields and if it doesn't kill
            the target it just stuns it for a couple of seconds.

            it down with ranged units (possibly flying ranged units), so they won't be stunned in

            Scott the Sensitive Savage is a tank(ish) DPS unit capable of dealing great damage, but
            you can count on him only until he reaches 50% hp, after that he will sit down and cry
            attracting every enemy on himself.
            <br />
            This taunt effect could be useful if you are planning to trap some of your enemy units
            (for example you could kill anyone who goes towards him with a spell), but it can also
            come handy when you reach the tower since it will leave most of your units free to deal
            damage while Scott the Sensitive Savage is tanking.

            The Scrat Launcher is a siege building, very good to cause massive damage to the enemy
            tower from a safer position. If you are able to keep it protected long enough, each shot
            will cause 100 damage, and can be very well a good victory condition.

            The Scrat Launcher is a VERY dangerous buinding and should be destroyed as soon as
            possible. To prevent damage to your tower, place other building between the tower and
            the Scrat Launcher so they'll be attacked instead. Since it's positioned near the gap in
            the middle of the battlefield, it's easier to take it down with ranged units like Fire
            Imp, or a flying unit or you could use Dragon Ball or Infiltration. Settsu Entry Blast
            is also a good way to deal with it.

            The Scrat Tank is one of the best tanks in game, since it won't take any damage until
            his lit is closed, and he opens it only when he's fighting melee. It's the perfect
            distraction for units like Harbinger or any other flying unit since they won't cause any
            damage until the Scrat Tank is not attacking something.

            The Scrat Tank is not a dangerous unit on his own, but it can become very annoying if
            it's protecting other units behind, since you can't destroy with anything (including
            spells) until he's not fighting something. So make sure to place another tank or melee
            unit in front of the Scrat Tank before spawning units (or casting spells) to damage him.

            one, causing MASSIVE damage. If you played another Zen-Chi card before using him, Shen

            The Swarmer Totem is a building that spawns 3 Swarmers every few seconds. It's very good
            to maintain the control of a bridge (especially if you are using Volco), and all those
            Swarmers will be quite annoying because your enemy units will have to fight them all to
            reach your tower, and if he's using Cleavers, he's going to waste a lot of time and give
            you the chance to kill them before they become a threat.

            The Swarmer Totem is an annoying building and like the Crossbow Guild it can become
            dangerous if too many units spawns without being killed. The best way to take care of it
            it's Magma Storm or Beam of Doom, since it will destroy the building and potentially
            damage also the enemy tower.

            The Wizard Puff is a DPS unit with a good damage, but the real strength of this unit is
            that if it dies, a random enemy minion will be turned into a Mana Puff. If enough Wizard
            Puffs gets killed you can clear lots of enemy minions (especially if your opponent is
            using only big ones), and at the same time gain several Mana Puffs that will increase
            your mana regeneration.

            The Wizard Puff is not a unit to be taken lightly, while it's easy to kill, you should
            make sure that when it dies you don't have big expensive minions around, or make sure to
            spawn a lot of small ones (like Scrat Horde) to decrease the chance that you're big
            minion becomes a Mana Puff. A Fireball or any spell capable of dealing 130 or more
            damage can kill it instantly, but remember to do so only if you don't have any important
            minion around.

            Toll of the Dead is a spell that summons an Undying Skeleton. The main difference is
            that after the second death, the Undying Skeleton remains will linger in the battlefield
            and when you reach Accoursed Ascension (by collecting 20 Spectral Essences), all the
            remains of the Undying Skeletons summoned by this cards will raise one more time.
            <br />
            Remember that each Toll of the Dead has an indipendent counter for the Undying
            Skeletons, so using multiple copies of this cards won't resurrect all the remains of all
            the Undying Skeletons around, but only the one summoned with that exact copy of the
            card.

            The Boom Buggy is a long ranged unit capable of dealing a huge amount of damage by
            shooting 6 rockets. The rockets hits up to 6 random targets splitting the damage between
            them, but if there is only 1 he'll gets hit by the full force of the Boom Buggy. Since
            it always split the rockets, it won't require to change target to hit new units
            (especially when attacking the enemy tower), so it can really be an invaluable addition

            The Rabid Prowler is exactly like the Prowler, but if there is a friendly unit with
            Rage, he also gain Rage. It's a good out of the box pick if you have at least a Rage
            card (like Tantrum Throwers) and you are NOT using King Puff.

            The Dragon Ball is a very useful spell that works like a Fireball, but if you played a 6
            (or more) mana minion before using it, it will also spawn a Dragon Whelp where it lands.
            <br />
            This spell is incredibly useful against many minions since it deals the Fireball damage
            AND the dragon will deal 50 damage per hit fast enough to take down the Harbinger but it
            can also be used to take down the Swarmer Totem or Crossbow Guild.
            <br />
            Using Dragon Ball against the tower while against Volco, this will cause massive damage
            unless your opponent uses ranged minions to kill the Dragon Whelp before it's too late.

            card gets a 1 mana cost discount for each Slitherbound you have on the field. If this
            card gets 3 stacks of Slitherbound, it is automatically counted as 3 mana discount on
            use. If you learn to manage the Slitherbound correctly, you will be able to summon a 5
            mana unit for free or max 2-3 mana in the worst case scenario.

            Bahra the Witchwolf is a powerful DPS capable of melting even the strongest tank in a
            matter of seconds. After spawning, Bahra the Witchwolf will root every enemy minion for
            6 seconds, so try to use this at your advantage to let her cause as much damage as
            possible in this short window of time.
            <br />
            Make sure to have a tank covering her while pushing forward or she can get killed pretty
            easily by melee units.
            <br />
            On death it grants 1 spectral essence, and when you reach 20 essences, other cards will
            gain a bonus effect (granted by Accursed Ascension).

            Bahra the Witchwolf is an extremely dangerous unit, make sure to kill it as fast as
            possible before she melts every minion you have and your tower. To kill her you need to
            let her come in your side of the battlefield, then place a melee unit (like Divine
            Warrior or Shieldguard of Light) straight on her face, and she'll be dead before you
            know it. Just be careful that the melee unit you use to kill her must have a solid
            health pool to resist a couple of her shots.

            The Empowered Soul Stealer, is a Soul Stealer with a wider range and if you have a unit
            with Rage around, he also gain 4 stacks on spawn. Like the Soul Stealer, this unit gains

            Howling Moon is a spell that reduces every minion in there is (friendly AND foe) at 50%
            hp (if they are already lower than 50% they won't be affected), and also spawn 2
            Werewolves where you cast the spell.

            If you have several units with Once Bitten, by using this spell, you'll turn them all
            into Werewolves, this strategy is ideal if you plan to get a Werewolf pack to take down
            the enemy tower. <br />
            This spell is better suited for Ravager, since when you reach perk 2 and your minions
            reaches less than 50% hp they gain frenzy.

            Enraging the Werewolves with Rampage or Morgrul's Ragers will make them really strong.

            On death each Werewolf grants 1 Spectral Essence, and when you reach 20 essences, other

            The Harbinger is the most powerful flying unit available in game. It has the longest
            range and damage a flying unit can have, the only downside is that he shoots at a very
            low speed.
            <br />
            If properly placed and protected it can fire anywhere in the battlefield, also
            everything hit by the Harbinger gets knocked back, so it's a good way to defend yourself
            against Rammers and Cleavers. If the Harbinger starts to attack the enemy tower, the
            damage will be compared to a Cleaver so it's a very solid victory condition.

            The Harbinger is an extremely dangerous unit, that should be taken out of the
            battlefield as soon as possible. To kill it you can use Beam of Doom or any spell
            capable of dealing 270 or more damage. A wise defense strategy against the Harbinger is
            to use Scrat Tank to soak the damage (since if it has no melee units attacking it, it
            won't take anu damage), then place any kind of ranged unit behind to take care of the
            Harbinger (like Plasma Marines, Crossbow Dudes or even a Succubus, the faster the
            better), by doing so, you'll take care of the Harbinger and you'll also have a nice
            group of units to push towards your opponent tower. <div style={{ clear: "both" }} />

            The Wreckinator 9000 is the most powerful Scrat unit available. This unit deal continuos
            damage in a frontal arc, then every 6 seconds slams the ground causing a bigger damage
            in a frontal cone and knocking every unit back. While it looks very powerful, there is a
            catch: when it reaches 350 health the self destruction will be initiated, it will start
            to taunt all the enemies and after 5 seconds it will explode causing 300 damage to
            friends and foes alike, making impossible to support it properly (since it will kill all
            the support units you put behind it).

            The Wreckinator 9000 is very dangerous since it can kill very easily most of the units
            and if it gets to your tower the damage caused will be very high (especially when it
            explodes). Make sure to deal with it before it reaches your tower by stunning it before
            it's too late. Once it's stunned is quite easy to kill. Also this unit is not capable of
            dealing air damage so you can use small air units to kill it pretty fast (like propelled
            scrats). <div style={{ clear: "both" }} />

            Caeleth Dawnhammer is a mediocre tank with a good damage output that also can become
            invulnerable for 5 seconds when Armor of Light triggers. Unfortunately since Armor of
            Light triggers AFTER he takes damage, he'll end up badly wounded and as soon as the
            invulnerability ends is dead. As it is Caeleth Dawnhammer mana cost is too high for what
            he does, but it could be used for defense purpose.

            Having 5 or more Empyrian cards in the deck (including Caeleth Dawnhammer), will also

            To kill a Colossus, make sure he gets half way between the bridge and you're tower, and
            place Stun Lancers to stop him while you take him down. If you don't have Stun Lancers,
            you can use small minions or Divine Warrior on the side of the bridge to keep him
            distracted, while you use other DPS to take him out. The Colossus is vulnerable to
            airborne minions so, use this at your advantage.

            Crakgul Doomcleaver is a glorified Cleaver that reduce the mana cost of 1 of the
            Voidborne cards you have in hand when he kills another minion or hits the tower.
            <br />
            Crakgul Doomcleaver can be nice to use if you have multiple Voidborne cards in your
            deck, just make sure that he kills at least 3 minions (or hits 3 times the enemy tower)
            to justify the mana cost of spawning him instead of a normal cleaver.

            Like the Cleaver, Crakgul Doomcleaver is one of the most dangerous minion around. It
            can't be killed in 1 shot, so you'll need to stop him by using a 1 mana minion or by
            keeping it stunned while other units kill him. You can also use hordes or flying minion
            to kill it.
            <br />
            Just remember that every kills and every hit to your tower he lands, will reduce the
            mana cost of a Voidborne card your opponent has by 1, so try to limit that as much as
            possible.

            The Red Golem is exactly like the Blue Golem, but if your tower has less than 50% hp, he
            gains double hp on spawn. This can make it an amazing tank if you're prepared to
            sacrifice half of your tower hp to get this bonus.

            The Red Golem, just like the Blue Golem, is an annoying unit that can easily kill come
            of your main DPS. This unit is quite weak against hordes and airborne minions, so use
            this at your advantage, or just keep it stunned with Stun Lancers and let your DPS kill
            him.
            <br />
            Remember that if your opponent's tower has less than 50% hp, this will take far more

            The Brothers of Light are 2 decent tanks with Armor of Light and a good damage output.
            This card can work well if you manage to put some DPS behind them (but it won't be easy

            Lord-Sentinel Thelec is a weak tank with acceptable DPS, that also spawn 6 Crystal
            Archers if you have at least 4 spells in your deck. Unfortunately the Crystal Archers
            gets destroyed with a single Daggerfall and Lord-Sentinel Thelec on his own is quite
            unimpressive to justify the mana cost.
            <br />
            If you're using Mordar and a tombstone manage to resurrect Lord-Sentinel Thelec, he also
            respawn all the archers.
            <br />
            If you use this unit in team, make sure your teammate brings Banner Man or Azali so he
            can shield Lord-Sentinel Thelec and all his Crystal Archers making it far more viable.
            Also remember to keep 6+ mana available while Lord-Sentinel Thelec is around to get the
            most damage from him and the Crystal Archers.

            take care of him with anything you want, just let a tank keep him still while your DPS

            Nyrvir the Fallen is a huge dragon capable of dealing a small but continuous amount of
            damage by channeling her breath in a cone in front of her, damaging ground and airborne
            units at the same time. She also deal 100 damage to all units around her after spawning.
            <br />
            Nyrvir the Fallen has the trait Mythic which makes here immune to instant kill effects
            (like Lightning Bolt or Wizard Puff), she will take 1000 damage instead of getting
            killed. Also she won't die, instead she will fly away (making it impossible to resurrect
            her with Mordar's tombstones).
            <br />
            While Nyrvir the Fallen has a lot of nice features, summoning her is not easy as it
            seems. In fact in order to summon Nyrvir the Fallen you need to reach Accursed Ascension
            (by collecting 20 Spectral Essences), then you can spend 10 mana and summon her. <br />

            If you don't have Accursed Ascension, Nyrvir the Fallen is replaced by Nyrvir's Slumber,
            a 3 mana spell that deals 70 damage to the closes 2 minions to the point you use it over
            2 seconds. Every unit killed by Nyrvir's Slumber will provide a Spectral Essence.
            <br />
            Since you just need to use Accursed Ascension just once per game, after you reach it,
            you'll have to use Nyrvir Slumber one more time, then you'll be able to summon Nyrvir
            the Fallen. After Nyrvir the Fallen dies, you'll need to use Nyrvir Slumber one more
            time before you can summon her again, and so on.
