        I remember when I started playing this game that was not easy to get into it, because there
        is a lot of stuff to do and you might not get it all at first so you might end up missing
        something important.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's start with the resources:

            <b>Gold</b>: gold is very important since it's your primary source of shards and cards.
            Spend this in the shop on good offers (especially to boost the cards you use) or to get
            power tokens (we'll see later why).

            <b>Shards</b>: shards are extremely important since with this you can craft cards. You
            shouldn't haste in spending shards since they are not easy to come by, spend them only
            to craft cards you really need, and start upgrading cards only when you are sure you
            don't need any other card.
            <br />
            You should NOT spend shards on season cards until you reach tier 99 or you will just
            spend 3 times more!!!

            <b>Rubies</b>: rubies are the most precious resource you have, you can rarely obtain it
            as a reward, and they can be bought for real money. With rubies you can buy stuff that
            with time can be obtained anyway. So how to get rubies is a personal choice based on if
            you have more time or money available. Just remember that even if you can buy enough
            rubies to get all the cards and masters (spending them wisely it can be done with about
            200€), <u>this won't give you any advantage in the game</u>, in fact the more stuff you
            have at the beginning, the more will be complicated for you to make a decent deck since
            you'll have too many options and not enough knowledge of the game to make a good choice.
            <br />
            <br />
            Remember to always keep 1,500 rubies available for the battle pass. That's one of the
            best ways to spend rubies since the rewards are usually VERY good!

          <b>Shop and Deals</b>

        To better understand the prices in the shop, you need to know the currency conversion:
        <br />
        1k gold = 80 rubies = 125 shards
        <br />
        <br />
        Also remember that you get 1 card from 1 token which cost 1k gold. So if you see for example
        25 common cards for 5k gold, it is actually a nice deal since you'll have to get 25 tokens
        to get the same amount of cards.
        <br />
        Just remember that a token gives you a card AND shards and the shop offers only give you the
        cards (you get shards only if you get beyond 400 glory for a specific card), so going back
        to the previous example, if you get 25 tokens and you get 25 common cards you also get 75
        shards, so it's still a very good deal.
        <br />
        <br />
        In general, if you see a single card for sell for less than 1k, is always a good deal.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, this is only if we speak about gold, if we speak about rubies, things are a bit
        different, since they are harder to come by, so you should only spend them for something
        that is really good...
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any doubt about if a shop offer is worth buying, do not hesitate to ask in
        general chat, there always is some veteran player that can help you with that.

        If you have some cash, the first thing to do is: DO NOT start spending it in rubies!

            able to buy around 50k Shards value of cards.
            <br />
            If you plan to upgrade all cards to 400 spending real money, don't do it, because it

            easy to get, you can buy them with gold if you are at the last day of the season and
            really desperate to get to 100, but it's usually a waste. Season Tokens are overpriced
            power tokens, so NEVER buy them! You can get the same cards with normal Power Tokens

          The cards drop rates when using a power token are one of the most asked question about
          this game, so here is the answer:

          <br />
          <ul className="bb_ul">
            <li>
              {" "}
              <b>Common (GREEN)</b>: 50%
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              <b>Rare (BLUE)</b>: 40%
              <br />

            <li>
              {" "}
              <b>Supreme (PURPLE)</b>: 8%

            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          As said before: remember that tokens are for <u>SHARDS</u>, so <b>DO NOT</b> obsess over
          tokens trying to get the card you want or you'll end up selling you're house before you
          find what you're looking for...
          <br />
          <br />
          Season Tokens turn into normal tokens at the end of the season so you have 2 options:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul className="bb_ul">
            <li>
              {" "}
              Use them all and upgrade all you're season cards before the season end. If you level
              up enough in the season, you'll have 90% of the season cards at least at 200+ glory,
              you can even get 1-2 of them to 400 glory too if you're lucky enough!
              <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              Keep all the season tokens and open them AFTER the season end. Several people like to
              do this, mostly because they don't like (or don't need) the season cards, and they'd
              rather spin normal tokens instead. If you still need most of the NON-SEASONAL cards,
              this can be a good method to find them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Personally I use all the season tokens so I can level up as much as possible the season
          cards, then I spend gold to buy normal tokens/good shop offers to level up the other
          cards. I also spend the shards to bring to 400 glory the card I use.{" "}

          The first day of every month the ranks resets and you can get the rewards all over again,
          plus an additional reward based on your previous month rank. The monthly reward is equal
          to all the rewards from wood to your <u>NEW</u> rank. Here is a table of what you're rank
          will be when the ranks reset:

          To get the highest rewards each month, you need to get to grandmaster in solo, team battle
          and premade team battle. This way you will get more than 1k rubies every month!{" "}

            So if you want to gain the most from the game, you'll need to reach at least tier 100 in
            the season and possibly reach Grand Master rank in all the game modes each month. This
            way you'll earn the highest amount of rewards possible and with that you'll have rubies
            to spare for the next season (possibly even spare rubies for good shop offers!).
            <br />
            <br />
            Also check the shop daily offers, because very often there is free stuff or great deals!{" "}
