You get closer to the action which feels more intense and interesting to watch.\\n        A slight radius increase separates minions more, but also helps control strategies maintain bridges.\\n        -We reduced visual noise and cleaned up environments to make Minions stand out. Things like lighting, fog, depth of field and other vfx changes bring together the environments.\\n        - Many assets were redone. Most notably “Area 52”, but many arenas have been updated.\\n        -Minion speed increased. This makes for quicker engagements and better focus during gameplay and on streams. Players can also produce viable counterpushes with regular Minions.\\n        You can read the details in the patch notes.",
